1)I have developed a model to predict the risk of suicides in US using various algorithms like Neural Network MLP, Random Forest, XGBoost.
Please look into it and put forward your reviews.


2)I have used VAR(Vector Autoregression ) and VARMA(Vector Autoregression Moving Average) to investigate causality between Money Stock and spending and found that for the time period under consideration, used in this model, there seems to be little inter-dependence.


3)A dataset on restaurants visited has been analyzed to study the affect of visitors during holidays(exogenous variable) . The model used is SARIMAX(Seasonal ARIMA exogenous).


4)Using deep learning model, the model predicts whether the customer who has taken loan will repay or not(Lending Club kaggle Data Set).

5)I have used Covnets to classify the category of animals using the famous Cats vs Dogs Dataset on Colab.

6)With the help of GRU layers, the text generating model generates a sequence of words that mimics the text it has been trained upon.

7)Morgan Stanley/ ADF Test and Johansen,Engel Granger test were run to check for if a time series is stationary and whether two time series are cointegrated.
